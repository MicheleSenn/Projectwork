## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) --> Lia

## Research Questions
<!-- (50-60 words) --> Michèle
<!--at least 2 research questions -->
1. How can the long-term effects of scare-off measures be modelled?
2. Can a trend of returning to the scare-off location be detected or even conceptualized?

## Results / products
<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? --> Lia
1. We expect a quick return to the relevant location (a few days or weeks max) without further scare-off measures.
2. We expect some kind of social behavior, e.g. lead and follow patterns.

## Data
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? --> Michèle
Long-term data for movement trajectories will be necessary (at least 6 weeks), different times of day, several individuals in a similar location
+ mapdata

## Analytical concepts
<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? --> Lia
Lead-and-follow, ...

## R concepts
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? --> Michèle
...

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? --> Lia
We try to minimize risks by choosing a topic with knowledgeable tutors and support.

## Questions?
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? --> Both
